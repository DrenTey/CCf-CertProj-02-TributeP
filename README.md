# CCf-CertProj-02-TributeP
Project done for Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp


## Aim of the project:
The goal of the second project was to ** build a webpage representing _a tribute_ to some person/event**.  
The main conditions as far as I remember were:
- It has to have a central image of the person to whom it is dedicated with included caption (figure, figcaption)
- It have to include a hyperlink (anchor element) which will open in the new tab a reference to wikipedia or other information source that I used/could be used to get know more about the subject.
- it has to have few section using bulletpoints?  

I was left free to decide upon colours and styles of the form.
As always the condtions for this certificate projects were:
- It had to be a personal work, using the knowledge learned through previous lessons. 
- It had to be build using html5 and css3.

I have decided to dedicate this webpage to Wilhelm Gesenius, whose grammar and lectionary I get to know through some of the studies that I have done.
## Website:
In this repository you can see the code of the project (index.html and styles.css).  
If you wonder how does the website look like, I deployed it  (making it live) through one of the options of profile on github.

Currently it can be seen also as a small internal website (iframe) on my website of my profile on github where I try to put recent project.
